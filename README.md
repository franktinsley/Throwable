# Throwable
Unity component that makes any game object it is attached to "throwable" using pointer input and physics.

How to Use:
Simply add a Throwable component to a GameObject and any Unity event system objects that are not yet in the scene will automatically be added for you. Then the game object will respond to both mouse and touch.
